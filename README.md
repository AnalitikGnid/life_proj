# life_proj
Project that I did in my first year.

The classical realisation of Conway's Game of Life

During pause mode (hold space), you can add(LMB) and remove(RMB) black fields.

Also, it is possible to upload combinations from the database folder (and save them). The field of the game is represented with .txt files with '0' for a black field and '.' - for a white one

Graphics is based on SFML-2.5.1.
The final application is also uploaded
